# Project Icon's

In this project i was trying to make the normal icon more intersting for typical website at the desktop.

## Version

For now the project is in the alfa version so he needs so many upgrades. In the feauter i will try to make the whole website for making animation for icons like this one. It will make the website more intersting and user friendly

## Installing

``` Terminal
git colne https://github.com/gonhak/Icon.git

cd Icon

npm install

gulp 
```
After this few coments you will be able to see how the project is looks like in the alfa version. If you will have some ideas to make this project better you can also make some fork then i will check it and for sure i'll think about your solution.
